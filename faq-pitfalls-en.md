## FAQ

{:toc}

### There are no names and currencies in my form. What do I do?

You can add them in the *overview* sheet or using the *other* fields in the form.
The form can then be updated using Add-ons->Gruppenkasse->Update form. *This may need some seconds of time and a reload of the form.*

### How do I remove a name or curency from my form and sheets?

You will need to remove it from all responses in the response sheet and the overview sheet.
Otherwise it will automagically be readded when *Update form* is trigered.

## Pittfalls

### Do not rename automaically generated sheets

Renaming overview or response sheets is currently not supported.
Renaming sheets will break:
1. automatic name updates
2. automatic currency updates
3. calculations in the overview sheet
